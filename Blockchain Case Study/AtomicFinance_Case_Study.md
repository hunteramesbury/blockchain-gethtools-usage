# Case Study Proposal: Atomic Finance

## What is it and why does it matter?:

Based in Toronto, Atomic Finance builds financial tools  secured by Crypto and blockchain technologies. Their first operation Atomic odds is a Bitcoin-native platform used for P2P betting. Atomic Odds allows users to have full control over bets made and even allows users to challenge influencers over twitter with Crypto based betting. With the use of bitcoin assurance, this service allows users bets to be verifiable and borderless by allowing users to bet with anyone across the world without currency restrictions as well as transactions can be verified and monitored with the Bitcoin platform. Atomic Odds uses atomic swap technology which allows the quick transaction and exchange of two different cryptocvurrencies. This technology allows for cross-chain trading (trading between blockchains) as well as removes the need for centralized exchanges (trustless trades). This technology removes barriers of entry for betting as it removes the needs for custodian fees which decreases entry costs and helps users verify trades increasing user security.

The second platform that Atomic Finance implemented Atomic Loans, allows users to collaterize loans with Bitcoin. Users crypto-backed loans removes middleman by using the same atomic swap technology used with Atomic Bets. By using atomic swaps, Atomic Loans allows users to interact with trustless cross-chain debt agreements by using BTC as collateral in a loan. This allows users to gain access to money without losing their bitcoin. This is useful in times of uncertainty where BTC market conditions are not favorable but users still need access to liquidity. Instead of trading bitcoin in and potentially losing money by liquidating their bitcoins early, users have the access to money by placing their bitcoin in a non-custodial escrow that is locked for the duration of your loan. Once market conditions are more favorable, users can then liquidate their BTC and pay of the loan. If a user needed money to pay for rent or their cost of living but BTC price is low, users can use their bitcoin as collateral and recieve a loan with a 10% APR interest rate to pay off their expenses then once bitcoin prices increase, the user can cash out and pay of their loan. One issue with this process is if the BTC market continues to decrease they may be forced to cash out regardless. However, this service still acts as security for investors when bitcoin prices are volatile.

Both of these services have different uses but act on the same premese of helping users save cost unecessary fees by removing the middle man. With both platforms using the atomic swap technology, users can go through both services processes without the need to interact with a human waiting to approve their transactions.
